## Executive Summary
ZET Bank faces challenges in managing and integrating financial data across cloud-based and on-premises sources. The current manual processes are error-prone and lack scalability. This project addresses these issues by designing and implementing a modern ETL pipeline using Talend, Azure SQL Database, and Snowflake to ensure data accuracy, operational efficiency, and timely insights for decision-making and customer support.

## Objectives
* Develop a robust ETL pipeline ():
    - The ETL will be reliable, efficient, and capable of extracting data from diverse cloud sources
* Load the data into AzureSQL Database and Snowflake():
    - Establish infrastructure and procedures required to oad transformed data into AzureSQL Database and Snowflake
* Streamline Data Export Process():
    - Automate the data export process to enhance efficiency and reduce manual effort.
* Time Efficiency and Cost Savings():
    - Automation reduces manual data extraction efforts and accelerates data availability
    - Cloud-based solutions often reduce infrastructure and maintenance costs.
